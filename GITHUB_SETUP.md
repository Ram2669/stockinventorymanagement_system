# 🌾 GitHub Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to push your SRI LAKSHMI ENTERPRISES Stock Management System to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Sign up at https://github.com if you don't have one
2. **Git Installed**: Should already be installed from the setup process

## 🚀 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `sri-lakshmi-stock-management`
   - **Description**: `🌾 Agricultural Stock Management System with beautiful farming theme`
   - **Visibility**: Select **"Public"** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (Advanced)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first: https://cli.github.com/
gh repo create sri-lakshmi-stock-management --public --description "🌾 Agricultural Stock Management System"
```

## 📤 Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Copy the commands from your new GitHub repository page, or use these (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sri-lakshmi-stock-management.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example with actual username:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ramgopal/sri-lakshmi-stock-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**:
   - Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Choose **"main"** branch
   - Choose **"/docs"** folder
5. Click **"Save"**

## ✅ Step 4: Access Your Live Website

After a few minutes, your website will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sri-lakshmi-stock-management
```

**Example:**
```
https://ramgopal.github.io/sri-lakshmi-stock-management
```

## 🔧 Step 5: Update Configuration for GitHub Pages

1. **Find your local IP address:**
   - **Windows**: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - **macOS/Linux**: Run `ifconfig` in Terminal
   - Look for your local network IP (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)

2. **Update the configuration file:**
   Edit `docs/config.js` and replace `YOUR_LOCAL_IP` with your actual IP:
   ```javascript
   PRODUCTION_API_URL: 'http://192.168.1.29:5001/api',  // Replace with your IP
   ```

3. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/config.js
   git commit -m "Update API configuration with local IP address"
   git push
   ```

## 🎯 Step 6: Test Your Deployment

1. **Start your local backend server:**
   - **Windows**: Run `start_server_windows.bat`
   - **macOS**: Run `./quick_start.sh`
   - **Linux**: Run `./start_server_linux.sh`

2. **Access your GitHub Pages site:**
   - Go to `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sri-lakshmi-stock-management`
   - The frontend will connect to your local backend API

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - View the dashboard
   - Search for products
   - Add new stock items
   - Record a sale and download receipt

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your **database** stays on your local machine (secure)
- Your **backend API** runs locally (only accessible from your network)
- Your **frontend** is hosted on GitHub Pages (publicly accessible)
- **Data** never leaves your local machine

## 📱 Mobile Access

Once deployed, you can access your system from mobile devices:
- **Local network**: `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5001` (when backend is running)
- **GitHub Pages**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sri-lakshmi-stock-management`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Repository Creation Issues:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Repository name must be unique
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens only

### Push Issues:
```bash
# If you get authentication errors, use personal access token
# Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
# Generate a new token and use it as your password
```

### GitHub Pages Not Working:
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check that you selected `/docs` folder as source
- Ensure repository is public
- Check the Pages section in repository settings for error messages

### API Connection Issues:
- Make sure your backend server is running locally
- Check that your IP address is correct in `docs/config.js`
- Verify firewall allows connections on port 5001

## 🎉 Success!

Once everything is set up, you'll have:
- ✅ **Code backed up** on GitHub
- ✅ **Frontend hosted** on GitHub Pages (free)
- ✅ **Database secure** on your local machine
- ✅ **Professional system** accessible worldwide
